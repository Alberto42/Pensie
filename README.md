Simple program that solves an algorithm [problem](https://szkopul.edu.pl/problemset/problem/4nwnYqhu2gE6dB5aJUCiltnu/site/?key=statement)
(unfortunately available only in Polish).

The problem is stated as follows. There is given a rooted tree with values from 1 to n on verticies. 
Values of some verticies might not be given(Let's call them "hidden"). Values in sub-trees are always smaller than value in parent.
Concerning that condition, our goal is to find as much hidden values as possible.
